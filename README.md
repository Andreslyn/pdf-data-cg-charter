"# pdf data charter" 

This repo is for the charter of a proposed W3C community group.

PDF has a reputation of being bad for ‘open data’, but there are already features of PDF that can be used for storing and retrieving data associated with parts of a PDF file, and more features coming.

charter should cover:

* Establish requirements for open data
* Use "CSV on the web" as a source of use cases
* Review proof of concept implementation
